# Custom-NER-model-using-Transformers-without-transfer-learning
• Built an NER model to extract Token as per user needs.  
• Bert NER Transformer was used to build a NER model based on the use case of extracting Attributes by training
model on custom dataset consisting of labeled text.  
• The current model was built from ground up without applying transfer learning techniques.  
• Extracted tokens are converted to a json file without redundant tokens.  
• Optimised and finetuned for providing best accuracy.
• Included validation cells to perform validation on trained model.
